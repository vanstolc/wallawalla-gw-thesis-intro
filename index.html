                <h2>Intro to the Walla Walla Sub Basin</h2>
                <p>The Walla Walla Watershed drains a large, agriculturally productive region
                    of Oregon and Washington defined geologically by the Columbia River Basalt.
                    My study area is the part of it that lies in Oregon, outlined on the map in red -
                    I'll refer to it as the Walla Walla Sub Basin (WWSB) </p>

                <p>My research is associated with the Oregon Water Resource Department's(OWRD)ongoing project to characterize 
                    the WWSB basalt groundwater system. In addition to my OSU thesis committee, I'm working with
                    hydrogeologists Jen Woody and Justin Iverson with the OWRD and Hank Johnson from the Portland office
                    of the US Geological Survey. </p>
                <h2> Abstract</h2>
                <p> My research will support groundwater management by using spatial analysis of geochemical samples 
                    to help determine whether local faults isolate compartments of groundwater. 
                    If this research confirms internal diversity within the aquifer, clusters of water users
                    drawing from the same aquifers can more effectively cooperate to prevent excessive groundwater
                    decline. I will test this by sampling approximately 35 wells drilled into a heavily faulted
                    area of the Columbia River Basalt, analyzing the samples for isotopes, cations, and anions,
                    and analyzing the similarities and differences between the spatial distribution of groundwater
                    geochemical signatures compared to the faults in the region. </p>

                <h2>A Diminishing Resource</h2>
                <p>The lowlands of the WWSB are intensively developed for agriculture and depend on both groundwater and surface water to irrigate in
                    an arid climate. The region gets on average 15 to 20 inches of rain per year, compared to Corvallis'
                    40 to 50 inches. Farmers in the WWSB make up the difference with surface water and groundwater pumped either from the
                    shallow sands and gravels along the Walla Walla River or from the deeper aquifers in the Columbia
                    River Basalt. </p>
                <p>Water levels in the basalt aquifer in the WWSB have been decreasing by up to 4 feet per year since the
                    1960s. A continued decrease would make many wells run dry if their owners cannot afford to drill deeper.</p>

                <h2>Why Won't Current Solutions Fix It?</h2>
                <p> Groundwater in Oregon is managed with the doctrine of prior appropriation, which in times of shortage
                    temporarily shuts off users with younger (junior) water rights so that users with older (senior) water rights can access their full allotted
                    amount of water. The prior appropriation doctrine assumes that all the water is coming from a common source, and that
                    cutting off junior users will results in more water available to senior users.
                    In a compartmentalized aquifer, this may not be the case. Faults can act as either flow paths or
                    flow barriers, and studies have shown that in the Deschutes Basin of the Columbia River Basalt the
                    faults block groundwater flow. However, no such studies have yet been done in the WWSB.</p>

                <h2>Current Management</h2>
                <p> When senior ground water users' "water call" requires that OWRD enforce the doctrine of prior appropriation,
                    the OWRD defines "Critical Groundwater Area" (CGA) in the appropriate geographical area.
                    In the nearby Critical Groundwater Areas located near Hermiston, Oregon, where water rights had been over-allocated, 67% of users lost their water
                    allocation to preserve the senior water rights of the remaining 33% when the area was declared a CGWA.</p>
                <p>The image below shows the distribution of ground water rights in the WWSB. Areas shaded in purple
                    indicate land that has a groundwaterright associated with it, for irrigation, temperature control, industrial, agricultural, or municipal supply.</p>

            <section data-scene="strategy">

                <h2>New Solutions</h2>
                <p> There is an urgent need for solutions to slow the decline in the basalt aquifer's water levels in the
                    WWSB. The silver lining of this is that it creates an opportunity to try new solutions. OWRD has two administrative tools available to reduce use: CGWA enactment or approving Voluntary Groundwater Agreements (VGAs) in the area, where both senior and
                    junior ground water right holders would collaborate to reduce their use of water instead of having
                    junior permit holders cut off entirely. However in order to do this, OWRD needs to know which
                    groups of water rights are drawing water from the same aquifer compartment, if the aquifer is
                    broken by faults. In an analogy completely motivated by a creative image found in an OWRD presentation,
                    the system may not be a bathtub but an egg carton, and we need to know
                    which users will share each cell.</p>

            <section data-scene = "goals">
                <h2>New Science</h2>
                <p> With OWRD's financial and field support for sampling and analysis, I will take water samples from
                    approximately 35 wells drilled into the basalt aquifer. Then, I will analyze those samples for
                    parameters that support 3 analytical goals to evaluate groundwater compartmentalization
                    : ion geochemistry profiling, age dating, and source water differentiation.</p>

                <p> As part of a standard geochemical assessment, I will analyze samples at OSU's IWW Collaboratory
                    for 4 cations and 5 anions in order to create a Stiff-Piper diagram of the results, which will help to see if there are clusters
                    of wells with similar chemistry. An example of this diagram from another set of sites is shown below:</p>
                <img src="img/stiff-piper.jpeg" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" height=400px width=400px alt="responsive image"
                     alt-text="Stiff-Piper diagram">
                <p> For age dating, water samples will be analyzed for tritium and carbon-14 at the USGS laboratory.
                    Finally, I will analyze water samples at OSU's Stable Isotope Laboratory for oxygen and hydrogen
                    isotope ratios. Both isotope data and age of the waters can indicate different sources
                    for the groundwater and provide additional methods to determine wells that draw from the same body of water.</p>

            <section data-scene = "analysis">
                <h2>Making Sense of the Data</h2>
                <p> Once the samples have been analyzed and the results are back, I will use geospatial methods to
                    evaluate the possibility of groups of wells with similar or unique water chemistry. This will
                    include spatial interpolation methods as well as analysis in a multivariate statistical package. 
                    An example of what spatial interpolation looks like is shown below, where the ages of homes in Corvallis, OR 
                    were evaluated using inverse distance weighting to create a "surface" showing areas of young and old 
                    construction compared to the road network which is overlaid. </p>
                <img src="img/spatial-interp-roads.JPG" class="img-responsive img-thumbnail" alt="responsive image"
                     alt-text="example of spatial interpolation">
                <p>I'll compare the chemical data to my understanding of the physical properties of the region,
                    such as faults, slopes, low permeability layers, and well construction characteristics. In particular I
                    will compare the spatial distribution of the chemical data to fault locations in order to test
                    the hypothesis that faults act as barriers to groundwater flow.</p>
